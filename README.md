Embodied AI Startup Founder
Independent AI researcher working on behavioral evaluation, epistemic robustness, and comprehension-gated intelligence systems.

## Research Program

My work studies how large language models fail under compression, adversarial pressure, and ethical stress.

Rather than optimizing for surface accuracy, I investigate structural robustness:
- Do models preserve constraints under ambiguity?
- Can they reject plausible falsehoods?
- Do they adapt behaviorally under pressure?
- Can capability growth be gated by demonstrated understanding?

The research arc progresses across four evaluation frameworks:

CDCT → DDFT → AGT → Comprehension-Gated Capability Growth
